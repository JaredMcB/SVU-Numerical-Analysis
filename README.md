# Southern Virgina University Numerical Analysis
## Class Project

This reposity contains a grab bag of resources for the learning and practice of numerical analysis at the undergraduate level. It is contributed to by the students MAT 410: _Introduction to Numerical Analysis_ at Sounthern Virginia University, Buena Vista, Virginia, spring 2024. The students will be adding to the course through out the semester.  

Soon we will be starting Chapter 2 of Burden, which covers solving equations of a single variable. in preparations for this I have started a Julia module called EquSolvers.jl. All of the code projects for chapter two will be held in this module.
